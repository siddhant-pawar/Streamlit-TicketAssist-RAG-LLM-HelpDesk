## Overall Structure and Functionality: 

### 1) chatboy.py:- 
- Streamlit Setup: Streamlit is used as the framework for creating a web-based user interface.
It allows for interactive elements like buttons, text inputs, and selection boxes to manage different aspects of ticket management and customer support.
- Session Management: Session state (```st.session_state```) is used to manage the state of buttons (```button_login``` and ```button_register```) to control page flow and prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously.
Sidebar Navigation: The sidebar provides navigation options for login (```button_login```) and registration (```button_register```). Clicking these buttons starts corresponding backend processes using subprocess.Popen.
- Ticket Submission: Users can submit tickets via a multiselect dropdown (```tproblem```) for various issues like account access, billing, etc.
Depending on the selected action ("```Create ticket```", "```Update ticket```", "```Delete ticket```"), different forms are presented to gather necessary details from the user.
- Database Interaction: The application interacts with a database (```cd.create_connection()``` and subsequent database operations using functions from cd module) to store and retrieve ticket information.
Operations include creating, updating, and deleting ticket records based on user inputs.
- Integration with Langchain (LLM):The chatbot functionality is integrated using ```llmf.show_chat_interface()```, powered by Langchain (LLM). This feature provides automated customer support and enhances interaction quality by leveraging AI.
Styling and UI Control: Custom CSS (```<style>```) is used to hide main menu, footer, and header elements (```#MainMenu, footer, header```). This ensures a clean and focused UI experience for the ticket management and chatbot interface.

### 2) backend/cuad.py

- MySQL Database Integration: MySQL Connector is used to establish a connection (```create_connection()``` function) with the database (```ticketdb```).
Functions (```create_record(), update_record(), delete_record(), fetch_ticketid_record()```) interact with the database to perform CRUD operations on ticket records.
- Ticket Management Functions:
  - Create Record: Allows users to create a new ticket record. Generates a unique ticket ID (```ticketid```) using Faker library and stores details such as user name, email, ticket type, enquiry details, problem type (```tproblem```), and priority based on problem type.
  - Update Record: Updates ticket details based on email (```temail```). Allows modification of ticket type and enquiry details.
  - Delete Record: Deletes a ticket record based on ```ticketid```.
  - Fetch Ticket ID: Retrieves ticket IDs associated with a given email (```temail```).

- Email Notification: ```send_email()``` function sends an email notification to users upon successful creation of a ticket. Uses SMTP for email delivery, requiring SMTP server details (```smtp.gmail.com```), sender email, and sender password.
- Priority Calculation and Display:
  - ```calculate_priority()``` calculates the age of a ticket to determine its priority.
  - ```priority()``` function demonstrates ticket prioritization based on age, sorting tickets into high, medium, and low priority levels. Displays prioritized tickets in Streamlit UI with color-coded indications of priority status.

### 3) backend/dashboard.py
- Imports: 
  - ```streamlit``` for creating the web-based dashboard.
  - ```mysql.connector``` for connecting to the MySQL database.
  - ```pandas``` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - ```plotly.express``` and ```matplotlib.pyplot``` for data visualization.
  - ```filter_dataframe``` from ```listalldata``` and functions from ```cuad``` (like ```priority, fetch_last_inserted_data, create_connection```) for additional data processing and database interactions.

- Functions:
  - ```fetch_data()```: Queries the ticketdb database to retrieve all data from the tdatabase table into a Pandas DataFrame (```df```).
  - ```Dashboard()```: Main function that builds the Streamlit dashboard interface.

- Dashboard Interface:
  - Title and Metrics:
    - Displays the title "Ticket Data Dashboard" using ```st.title()```.
    - Uses ```st.metric()``` to show total counts of unique users (```total_users```), unique ticket IDs (```total_ticketid```), and unique problems (```total_problem```).

  - Tabs:
      - Utilizes ```st.tabs()``` to organize content into tabs ("last priority" and "time priority").
      - Inside tabs, calls ```fetch_last_inserted_data(connection)``` and ```priority()``` functions to display relevant data related to ticket priorities and dates.
- Dataframes and Charts:
  - Dataframe Display: Uses ```st.dataframe()``` to display filtered data (```filter_dataframe(problem_data)```).
  - Bar Charts: Utilizes ```st.bar_chart()``` to visualize counts of problem types (```problem_type_counts```), ticket types (```ticket_type_counts```), and priority levels (```priority_counts```).
- Styling: Includes a custom CSS style (```hide_st_style```) to hide the main menu, footer, and header for a cleaner dashboard appearance.

### 4) /backend/intergationopration.py
